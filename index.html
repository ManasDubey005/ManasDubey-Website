        <p class="lead mb-4">Enter bio here<br>Hochschild's article starts out with an anecdote talking about the busy working American life. On how they work from 9 to 5 sometimes even more barely spending much time with family as they are invested in their career and responsibility. Then it delved into the fact that companies do offer options that help people gain more personal time and it was thought that many did not take this option as they just could not afford it. The real answer turned out to be that many seemed to start getting the solace they received from home at work. Their workplace seemed to serve as a gateway away from the emotions, needs and responsibilities that come from a family. They start to back this up with a story about how a mom named Linda takes overtime to escape the demands of her child and her husband, using work as a getaway. It started to look into a company Americo and examine the multiple ways workers evaded the ‚Äútime bind‚Äù, from putting the work of a parent on someone else to projecting an ideal sense of spending time by buying equipment for the activity.

        Enter bio here<br>Ehrenreich starts his piece with how no matter how menial the task is at hand minimum wage jobs require new skills, training and no one is gifted at that type of labor. Ehrenreich then examined the difficulty of surviving on minimum wage and found it near impossible. He could not live comfortably, always having to hustle, needing to work seven days a week and always worrying about inconveniences occurring. Through moving around and holding jobs he made it apparent standard of living was way higher than wages being distributed. He explains the given advantage the rich have on the poor when it comes to the housing market and even explores how the government calculates the cost of living in an outdated archaic way. Ehrenreich explores why the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù don‚Äôt take more high paying jobs and this is usually caused by the system in place. It prevents them from combing together and presenting a joined force and how the system treats the individuals. Surprised to find how people who stand up for better treatment are systematically harassed. Near the end Ehrenreich talks about his return to the upper middle class enjoying the final things in life and highlighting the ever present polarizing line that is radiating throughout society.

        Enter bio here<br>Gowan explorers the people who scavenge for recyclables for a living. He examines what usually takes place, people scouring the early streets claiming recyclables before other individuals and notes the increase in this activity among the less fortunate. He attributes this due to the decrease in formal work or specifically industrial jobs. Gowan explains that most people in this situation end up from a series of economic and emotional strains couped with long-term unemployment. Gowan explains how welfare for these individuals wouldn‚Äôt help as in California during this time welfare was shriveling up in itself. He starts talking about how companies started to make these informal garbage collectors, cheap laborers instead of having them compete with formal laborers from these companies. He talks about how recycling became an identity for these people as it enabled them to join society as a working class citizen instead of being classified a ‚Äútramp‚Äù. Many fight the image of being homeless bums and actively try to show they are trying to make changes even straying away from shelters. Gowan talks about how many of these individuals turn to recycling as it shows their peculiar skills and it is the job they can best earn at. They set up a new president to redefine homeless to not attribute it to a negative connotation.
